# Portfolio
This repository is a collection of code that aims to showcase some of what I am able to do. This is by no means an exhaustive list as some code is under NDA or is a specific piece of IP. Some of these include API calls to cloud services (GCS, AWS, Arduino Cloud etc), using LLM agents, and building dashboards with docker containers. Only the data that is not protected by NDA or IP is used. </br>
This will continually be added to, so watch this space! </br>

## Description
### PhD
Various code examples I used during the PhD.
- **dark_machines**: details the testing of CNN-VAEs for the classification of signal from background in dark matter data. Contains beta-VAE, as well as code to assess performance and read in the data we used for the project. 
- **dijet_resonance_algorithm_comparison**:
- sdf
