# Portfolio
This repository is a collection of code that aims to showcase some of what I am able to do. This is by no means an exhaustive list as some code is under NDA or is a specific piece of IP. Some of these include API calls to cloud services (GCS, AWS, Arduino Cloud etc), using LLM agents, and building dashboards with docker containers. </br>
This will continually be added to, so watch this space! </br>
